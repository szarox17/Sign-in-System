Code and other files needed for the Senior Design 2 Project
The SPDT switch, button and LED strip have a code sequence to test each. This can be integrated into another set of code meant to run a sequence of events necessary for the project.
There are 4 GPIOs connected with the button having 1, the rocker switch having 2, and the LED with 1. I have both a 5V and 12V power source (12V for the LEDs alone)
